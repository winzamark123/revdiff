# revdiff

TUI for reviewing diffs, files, and documents with inline annotations, built with bubbletea.

**Architecture**: see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design, data flows, interfaces, and design decisions.

## Commands
- Build: `make build` (output: `.bin/revdiff`)
- Test: `make test` (race detector + coverage, excludes mocks)
- Lint: `make lint` or `golangci-lint run`
- Format: `make fmt` or `~/.claude/format.sh`
- Generate mocks: `go generate ./...`
- Vendor after adding deps: `go mod vendor`

## Project Structure
- `app/` - composition root (`package main`), split by concern: `main.go` (entrypoint + `run()`), `config.go` (options/parsing), `stdin.go` (stdin mode), `renderer_setup.go` (VCS wiring), `themes.go` (theme CLI + adapter), `history_save.go` (session save)
- `app/diff/` - VCS interaction (git + hg + jj), unified diff parsing, VCS detection, Mercurial + Jujutsu support. `compare.go` — `CompareReader` renderer for `--compare-old/--compare-new` (runs `git diff --no-index`, no repo required)
- `app/ui/` - bubbletea TUI package. Single `Model` struct with state grouped into sub-structs (`cfg`, `layout`, `file`, `modes`, `nav`, `search`, `annot`), methods split across files by concern (~500 lines each). Each source file has a matching `_test.go`. See `app/ui/doc.go` for package docs, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for file-by-file breakdown. Does not import `app/theme` or `app/fsutil` — theme operations go through the `ThemeCatalog` interface
- `app/ui/style/` - color/style resolution: hex-to-ANSI, lipgloss styles, SGR tracking, HSL math. Types: `Resolver`, `Renderer`, `SGR`
- `app/ui/sidepane/` - file tree + markdown TOC components with cursor/offset management
- `app/ui/worddiff/` - intra-line word-diff: tokenizer, LCS, line pairing, highlight insertion
- `app/ui/overlay/` - layered popups: help, annotation list, theme selector. Manager enforces one-at-a-time
- `app/highlight/` - chroma syntax highlighting, foreground-only ANSI
- `app/keymap/` - configurable keybindings (`Action` constants, parser, defaults, dump)
- `app/theme/` - Catalog-centric theme system: `Theme` (data + serialization) and `Catalog` (discovery, loading, installation, gallery). Zero standalone functions — all logic as methods. Files: `theme.go` (Theme struct), `catalog.go` (Catalog struct + all operations). 7 bundled + community gallery
- `app/annotation/` - in-memory annotation store and structured output
- `app/editor/` - external `$EDITOR` invocation: annotation temp-file lifecycle via `Command()` and existing source-file launches via `SourceCommand(SourceRequest)`, including editor-specific line/workspace arguments. Consumed by `app/ui` via the `ExternalEditor` interface
- `app/history/` - review session auto-save to `~/.config/revdiff/history/`
- `app/fsutil/` - filesystem utilities
- `app/ui/mocks/` - moq-generated mocks (never edit manually)

## Architecture Principles
- **Decouple OS/external concerns from UI**: OS-level work (exec.Command, os.CreateTemp, env lookup, network calls) does not belong in `app/ui/`, even for small helpers. Extract to a dedicated package (e.g. `app/editor/`) even when there's only one production caller. The cost of a new package is lower than keeping `app/ui/` entangled with OS boundaries.
- **Minimize exported surface**: first pass of a new package almost always over-exports. Before finalizing, ask "which of these does the caller actually need?" and unexport the rest. For stateless helpers, prefer unexported methods on the grouping struct over top-level unexported functions — matches the global "prefer methods over standalone utilities" rule.
- **Consumer-side interfaces for external deps**: when UI uses an external subsystem, the default shape is: interface in `app/ui/` (consumer side), concrete type in the subsystem package, injection via `ModelConfig` (nil defaults to concrete). Direct import of a concrete type from an external package into `app/ui` is a smell — the interface documents the dependency direction and leaves room for alternate implementations, not just test mocks.

## Config
- Config file: `~/.config/revdiff/config` (INI format via go-flags IniParser)
- Precedence: CLI flags > env vars > config file > built-in defaults
- `--dump-config` outputs current defaults, `--config` overrides path
- `no-ini:"true"` tag excludes fields from config file (used for --config, --dump-config, --dump-theme, --list-themes, --init-themes, --version)
- Themes dir: `~/.config/revdiff/themes/` with 7 bundled themes, auto-created on first run
- `--theme NAME` loads theme; `--dump-theme` exports resolved colors; `--list-themes` lists available; `--init-themes` re-creates bundled
- Theme precedence: `--theme` overwrites all 23 color fields + chroma-style, ignoring `--color-*` flags or env vars
- Theme values applied via `applyTheme()` in `themes.go` which overwrites `opts.Colors.*` after `parseArgs()`. `colorFieldPtrs(opts)` is the single source of truth for color key → struct field mapping — adding a new color requires changes in `theme.go` colorKeys + options struct + `colorFieldPtrs()` in `themes.go`
- Theme ownership split: `app/theme.Catalog` owns discovery/loading, `app/ui.ThemeCatalog` interface consumed by UI, `app/themes.go` wires adapter composing catalog + config persistence
- `ini-name` tags ensure config keys match CLI long flag names
- Keybindings file: `~/.config/revdiff/keybindings` (`map <key> <action>` / `unmap <key>` format)
- `--keys` overrides keybindings path, `--dump-keys` prints effective bindings
- **CLI flag description style is minimal and atomic** — match `--staged` ("show staged changes") / `--blame` ("show blame gutter"). Never include "at startup", "on startup", "(mirrors X toggle)", "(same state as X)", or cross-references to runtime toggle keys in the struct tag description, README/docs.html/plugin config.md table rows, godoc, or usage example comments. The flag description states what the flag does; users discover runtime toggles via the keybindings table or status-bar legend. This rule applies to every surface that describes a flag.
- **Mode-gating pattern for CLI flags with mode-dependent applicability**: when a flag is meaningful in some modes (working-tree, single-ref, `--staged`) but not others (two-ref, `--stdin`, `--compare-old/--compare-new`), gate it at the composition root via a method on `options` that returns the resolved bool, parallel to `options.ref()`. Example: `options.startupUntracked()` returns `false` in two-ref mode (`a b` or `a..b`) so working-tree state doesn't leak into historical diffs. `main.go` then wires `ShowUntracked: opts.startupUntracked()` into `ModelConfig`. The Model takes the resolved bool — it does NOT re-derive from CLI options or refs. Composition-root gating composes cleanly with the Model's own capability gate (e.g. `cfg.ShowUntracked && cfg.LoadUntracked != nil`) which handles the stdin/compare modes where the loader function is nil.

## Website
- Static site in `site/` (index.html, docs.html, style.css), deployed to revdiff.com via Cloudflare Pages
- Cloudflare Pages strips `.html` and 308-redirects `/docs.html` → `/docs`. Canonical tags, `og:url`, and `sitemap.xml` entries for documentation pages must use the extension-less URL (`/docs`), not the source filename (`/docs.html`), or Google indexes a redirect and tanks CTR
- `site/docs.html` must stay in sync with README.md - when adding features, flags, keybindings, or modes, update both
- `site/index.html` landing page should reflect major new features in the features grid and plugin sections
- **CRITICAL: After each release, update the version badge in `site/index.html`** (search for `hero-badge` div) and `softwareVersion` in JSON-LD

## Claude Code Plugin
- Plugin lives at `.claude-plugin/` with `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `skills/`
- Skills path in `plugin.json` is relative to repo root, not to `.claude-plugin/`
- **CRITICAL: Version bumps happen at release only — never per-PR or per-change.** Do NOT prompt to bump `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` after a plugin file change; the bump is done as part of the release process.
- When bumping at release, keep each marketplace entry synchronized with its plugin manifest. For `revdiff-planning`, update both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` plus its version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- **CRITICAL: Defer plugin version bumps when the change depends on a new binary feature.** If a plugin/launcher change relies on a `revdiff` binary feature, flag, env var, or exit code that is not yet in a tagged release, do NOT bump `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` / `package.json` on the feature branch. The plugin (marketplace) and the binary (brew / `go install`) version independently — bumping the plugin early ships an updated launcher to users still running an old binary, causing a hard mismatch (e.g. the launcher passes an unknown flag, the old binary exits 1, every plugin-triggered review fails). Bump plugin/package versions as part of the binary version release, after the binary is tagged.
- Reference docs at `.claude-plugin/skills/revdiff/references/` — keep in sync with README.md:
  - `install.md` — installation methods and plugin setup
  - `config.md` — options, colors, chroma styles
  - `usage.md` — examples, key bindings, output format
- **Adding a new CLI flag requires SKILL.md updates, not just reference docs.** `references/config.md` and `references/usage.md` document the flag's *existence*; `SKILL.md` teaches AI agents *when* to pass it during automatic launches (e.g. "pass `--untracked` when the recent change likely created new untracked files"). Without a SKILL.md entry, AI agents using the plugin will not know to pass the flag even though it's documented. Apply the same update to `plugins/codex/skills/revdiff/SKILL.md` (keep in sync with `.claude-plugin/skills/revdiff/SKILL.md`) and to `plugins/pi/skills/revdiff/SKILL.md` (which lists user-facing command examples). The launcher scripts (`launch-revdiff.sh`) pass `"$@"` through, so no script changes are needed beyond updating the usage-comment header for documentation parity.
- **Launcher override chain**: both Claude plugins resolve their launcher script via `resolve-launcher.sh` through `user → bundled` layers (first executable wins). The planning plugin's user layer is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/scripts/<launcher>` under Claude and `${PLUGIN_DATA}/scripts/<launcher>` under Codex. There is **no project-level (`.claude/...` or `.codex/...`) executable layer by design** — the planning hook fires automatically in any repo, and a repo-controlled launcher would run on routine agent actions. The Pi extension and manual Codex diff-review skill do not use this plugin-data override.
- **Launcher env vars don't reach the tmux/zellij popup**: `launch-revdiff.sh` spawns the revdiff process in a fresh shell inside the multiplexer popup that does NOT inherit the parent shell's environment, so env-var config set before the launch is dropped (e.g. `REVDIFF_THEME=gruvbox launch-revdiff.sh HEAD~10` does not apply the theme). Pass it as a CLI flag instead: `launch-revdiff.sh --theme gruvbox HEAD~10`. Applies to any env-var-configurable option launched through the overlay.
- **Testing locally**: `claude --plugin-dir .claude-plugin` loads the diff-review skill from this checkout without going through the marketplace; `claude --plugin-dir plugins/revdiff-planning` does the same for the planning hook. Use `/reload-plugins` to pick up file edits mid-session.

## Codex Plugin and Skills
- Codex skills live at `plugins/codex/skills/` — two skills: `revdiff` (diff review) and `revdiff-plan` (plan review via last Codex assistant message)
- Manual skill install copies to `~/.codex/skills/<name>/`; automatic plan review is distributed separately through the `revdiff-planning` Codex plugin
- Keep Claude's default-discovered `PreToolUse/ExitPlanMode` config in `hooks/hooks.json`; the Codex manifest explicitly points its opt-in `Stop` hook at `hooks/codex-hooks.json`
- Script path resolution in SKILL.md falls back to `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/<skill>/scripts` when not running inside the revdiff repo
- Scripts are copies from `.claude-plugin/skills/revdiff/scripts/`, not symlinks — each has a source comment at top
- `detect-ref.sh` dispatches by VCS (`detect_git` / `detect_hg` / `detect_jj`) via `command -v` probes (jj → git → hg, matching `DetectVCS` precedence); git path stays byte-identical to the pre-refactor output. `read-latest-history.sh` uses the same VCS probe order for repo-root resolution.
- Codex automatic plan review runs only for `permission_mode=plan`, prefers a complete plan in `last_assistant_message`, and falls back whenever that field has no complete block to the last assistant message for the exact transcript/session/turn; manual `/revdiff-plan` remains the best-effort rollout fallback

## Pi Plugin
- Pi package defined in root `package.json`, extensions and skills in `plugins/pi/`
- Pi review path is direct-terminal only: `/revdiff [args]` suspends pi, runs the `revdiff` binary directly, and sends captured annotations to the agent immediately. There is no Pi overlay mode, pending annotation widget/panel, `/revdiff-rerun`, `/revdiff-results`, `/revdiff-apply`, `/revdiff-clear`, or default post-edit reminder command.
- Pi ships its own copy of `detect-ref.sh` at `plugins/pi/scripts/detect-ref.sh` (source-of-truth is `.claude-plugin/skills/revdiff/scripts/detect-ref.sh` — keep in sync, same pattern as the codex copy). The pi extension resolves the script relative to its own plugin root, never via `.claude-plugin/`; the pi package must stay installable standalone with no Claude plugin files present. Do not re-add `launch-revdiff.sh` to the Pi package surface unless the workflow is explicitly changed.
- **CRITICAL: Version bumps happen at release only — never per-PR or per-change.** Do NOT prompt to bump `package.json` after a pi plugin file change; the bump is done as part of the release process.
- Version in `package.json` is independently versioned (does not track the project's git tags)
